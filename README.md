# diamond_prices_study_project
My first data analysis repository on git, in this project I'm gonna to predict diamond prices, based in a trainning dataset. This project was part of Udacity nanodegree I've made in 2018.

At the time, I was made this using Alteryx. Today I'll do this on Python, R and Knime, to show de difference between codes, that I'll publish in a Medium post.
